1.08

* Extended capacity of the filter input field
* Now the SIMD filter works with filters of all sizes (previously it was only running with words bigger than 3 characters)
* Implemented IDs for each word in the filter, so if we remove one that it's in the middle it does not offset all the colors/toggles.

1.09

* Fixed issue introduced in the previous version where it was not loading properly the colors of the presets
* Now where adding new filter it will pickup a color for the default palette
