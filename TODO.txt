================ NOTES 

// Now each time we add a condition to the filter it will pick up a different default color.
// Replace the color picker with default colors selection.
// Now the settings and the filters are being save as .json
// Added new option to override existing saved filter
// Added version num
// Added the functionality to copy/paste current filter into the clipboard (useful for sharing and to paste in multiple CT instances).
// Added 2 new context menu in Filter/Presets to fit more options.

================ Backlog

// Support to listen from a websocket?
// Support through multiple logs -> TabItemButton
// Remove window border?

================ Next

// don't cleanup when switching to streaming, because we loose the path, or at least reapply
// If press saved in a filter that already exist Modify it instead of append
// Release builds should not create the temp dll
// Add ms performance,
// Check for memory leaks
// Think on how to support multiple processes writing in the FolderQuery
// Save Target input field values?

// Select char by mouse movement (think on how I can integrate seemingly into the highlight array)

// See multithreading chili videos
// do multithread for the pass filter
// load the txt in a multithread pass

// should I save the cherry pick?

// Next dispatch load file + filter in a different thread to avoid locking the app when huge .logs are being loaded/filter.

// How I can do to prevent color being offset when changing the filter? 
// I need to have a way to understand which filter was removed, let it sink a little bit
// if they change words, and change sizes, there is no way to ensure to adjust it properly,
// since I don't know which filter was removed and which was modified


// should I save the sets in the users?
